If you havenâ€™t read:

A Practice Guide to Patterns 7 by James Harkins (Excellent tutorial).
The JITLib Tutorial (not as good, but JITLib is probably what you want)
then you should. You might also then want to read: [How I Live Code](https://theseanco.github.io/howto_co34pt_liveCode/ 7] to see a practical way in which you might apply these these things.
